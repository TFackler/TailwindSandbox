This is a sandbox project for getting the gist of tailwindcss.

### Working on the project
- You can make tailwind automatically update the `main.css` on file changes by using the script `npm run watch`. 
- It is also recommended to use the "Tailwind CSS IntelliSense" (adds autocomplete) and "Headwind" (automatically sorts tailwind classes) extensions in vscode to aid development.
- More scripts are available in the `package.json`.
